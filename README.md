This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and later migrated to use Vite.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npx vite`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npx vite build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
